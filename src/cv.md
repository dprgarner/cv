soundbite: Full-stack web developer with a focus on front-end web development
description: >
  I'm a software developer based in London, currently working as a technical team lead and a full-stack web developer. My main interests are in front-end development, in particular with modern JavaScript tools and libraries such as React and Redux, but I also have considerable professional experience in back-end development with Django, Python, and Node.js. I place a strong emphasis on quality in all of my code, and consider automated testing and code review to be essential to the development process.
