soundbite: Software developer with a focus on front-end web development
description: >
  I'm a full-stack web developer and technical team lead based in London. My primary focus is front-end development with React, but I also have considerable professional experience in back-end development with Node.js, Python, and Django. I place a strong emphasis on quality in all of my code, and consider unit testing and code review to be essential parts of the development process.

## Employment History

### **2020–present: Senior Front-end Lead**, then **Technical Front-end Lead** at QMetric, London, UK

I took ownership of the JavaScript codebases within a home insurance platform.

- I maintained and extended a customer-facing app and a backoffice app for purchasing and modifying home insurance policies, with front-ends and backends-for-frontends implemented in React, Express, TypeScript, and RxJS.
- I provided technical leadership, architecture design, and support on a wide range of parallel projects and initiatives, including the front-end rebuilds of the insurance risk form, the quote landing page, and the payments page, as well as the introduction of user-behaviour-tracking analytics and A/B testing.
- I worked with business analysts and delivery managers to break down high-level business requirements into self-contained user stories for development.
- I participated in large-scale architecture discussions with the other tech leads and tech principals to plan the evolution of our cloud-native, event-driven, microservice-architectured insurance platform, implemented primarily in Java with Domain Driven Design.
- I conducted interviews for candidate front-end developers, as well as setting and marking take-home assessments.
- I organised and conducted onboardings, team training meetings, and technical design discussions within a fully-remote team.
- I initiated and assisted with multiple tech-debt initiatives, including the migration of the codebase away from RxJS, the Docker containerisation of the legacy services, and the introduction of browser-side error monitoring and reporting.
- I designed, prototyped, and initiated the implementation of a Microfrontend architecture across our front-end codebase to support multiple teams developing the same application in parallel.

### **2015–20: Software Developer**, then **Engineering Lead (2019-20)** at Mintel, London, UK

I gained a wide range of experience with legacy and new codebases primarily using React, Redux, Django, Solr, and Elasticsearch. I worked on multiple projects, including:

- Apps for aggregating and presenting direct marketing data and consumer survey data into tables, charts, and dashboards;
- Apps for searching, reading, and generating presentations from long-form market research articles;
- Internal tools for browser-based Selenium testing, visual regressions testing, and internal front-end libraries for implementing cross-company stylistic consistency.

#### As the Technical Lead for a search app:

- I held responsibility for technical direction, tech-debt prioritisation, and code quality standards;
- I worked with Product Development and Project Leads to translate the business and technical requirements for new features into Jira issues for implementation by the developers in London, Chicago, and Shanghai;
- I joined remote and in-person interview panels for potential interns, graduate developers, and senior front-end developers.

#### In addition to my main project work:

- I designed and reviewed component APIs for the front-end component libraries, emphasising backwards-compatibility and extensibility;
- I helped found the "Front-End Chapter", a cross US-UK team group dedicated to sharing knowledge and best practices in front-end development;
- I gave talks on Visual Regressions testing, TypeScript, Styled Components, and design patterns in React;
- I held a half-day introductory workshop on React and our internal UI Components library;
- I ran a lunchtime "Coding Club" teaching front-end frameworks and TDD;
- I organised and participated in internal coding competitions on competitive game-playing AIs and image classification with neural networks.
