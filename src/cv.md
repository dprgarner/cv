soundbite: Software developer with a focus on front-end web development
description: >
  I'm a full-stack web developer and technical lead based in London. My primary focus is front-end development with JavaScript and React, but I also have considerable professional experience in back-end development with Node.js, Python, and Django. I place a strong emphasis on quality in all of my code, and consider unit testing and code review to be essential parts of the development process.

## Employment History

### January 2022 - Present: YLD, London, UK (Contract role)

#### **Senior Software Engineer** at Zoa, Jan 2023 - Present

I worked as a consultant from YLD for the energy tech start-up Zoa as they broke away from Bulb and formed an independent company to create white-label apps and tools for energy suppliers.

- I worked with the "apps platform" team to build and maintain a monorepo containing our web apps, native apps, and backend-for-frontend services, and designed architectural and usage patterns for developers creating product features;
- I built the core code of the React and React Native features allowing an energy consumer to manage their electric vehicle charging schedules and view their household energy consumption;
- I designed and implemented an approach for "universal" client-side navigation wrapping around web and native navigation libraries;
- I helped create an internal design system, building components and designing their APIs, with an emphasis on accessibility, universality between web and native, and ease-of-integration for developers;
- I participated in technical design and modelling discussions on the energy supply domain and our platform architecture;

#### **Senior Software Engineer** at Bulb, Jan 2022 - Dec 2022

I worked as a consultant from YLD for the energy supply company Bulb.

- I maintained the legacy energy usage charts in the mobile app, fixing issues in the React Native front-end, the backend-for-frontend Apollo server, and the back-end TypeScript microservices;
- I helped build a feature to allow users to see a breakdown of their household energy usage, with a data-ingestion pipeline using GCP PubSub and an integration to a third party providing the disaggregation model;
- I assisted and trained my team in designing backwards-compatible GraphQL schemas, emphasising stability in previously-released versions of the mobile app;
- I created a budget-setting feature to allow customers to track their energy usage, with mobile push notifications implemented in Firebase;
- I joined technical design discussions with technical leads and engineers.

### April 2020 – October 2021: QMetric, London, UK

#### **Senior Front-end Lead**, then **Technical Lead (from November 2020)**

I took ownership of the JavaScript codebases within a home insurance platform.

- I maintained and extended a customer-facing app and a backoffice app for purchasing and modifying home insurance policies, with front-ends and backends-for-frontends implemented in React, Express, TypeScript, and RxJS.
- I provided technical leadership, architecture design, and support on a wide range of parallel projects and initiatives, including the front-end rebuilds of the insurance risk form, the payments page, and the landing page, as well as the introduction of user-behaviour-tracking analytics and A/B testing.
- I worked with business analysts and delivery managers to break down high-level business requirements into self-contained user stories for development.
- I participated in large-scale architecture discussions with the other tech leads and tech principals to plan the evolution of our cloud-native, event-driven, microservice-architectured insurance platform, implemented primarily in Java with Domain Driven Design.
- I conducted interviews for candidate front-end developers, as well as setting and marking take-home assessments.
- I organised and conducted onboardings, team training meetings, and technical design discussions within a fully-remote team.
- I initiated and assisted with multiple tech-debt initiatives, including the migration of the codebase away from RxJS, the Docker containerisation of the legacy services, and the introduction of browser-side error monitoring and reporting.
- I designed, prototyped, and initiated the implementation of a Microfrontend architecture across our front-end codebase to support multiple teams developing the same application in parallel.

### **August 2015 – March 2020**: Mintel, London, UK

#### **Software Developer**, then **Engineering Lead (from March 2019)**

I gained a wide range of experience with legacy and new codebases primarily using React, Redux, Django, Solr, and Elasticsearch. I worked on multiple projects, including:

- Apps for aggregating and presenting direct marketing data and consumer survey data into tables, charts, and dashboards;
- Apps for searching, reading, and generating presentations from long-form market research articles;
- Internal tools for browser-based Selenium testing, visual regressions testing, and implementing a cross-company design system.

#### As the Technical Lead for a search app development team:

- I held responsibility for technical direction, tech-debt prioritisation, and code quality standards;
- I worked with Product Development and Project Leads to translate the business and technical requirements for new features into Jira issues for implementation by developer teams in London, Chicago, and Shanghai;
- I joined remote and in-person interview panels for hiring senior front-end developers, graduate developers, and interns.

#### In addition to my main project work:

- I designed and reviewed component APIs for the front-end component libraries, emphasising backwards-compatibility and extensibility;
- I helped found the "Front-End Chapter", a cross US-UK team group dedicated to sharing knowledge and best practices in front-end development;
