soundbite: Technical lead with a focus on front-end web development
description: >
  I'm a full-stack web developer and technical team lead based in London. My primary focus is front-end development with React, but I also have considerable professional experience in back-end development with Django, Python, and Node.js. I place a strong emphasis on quality in all of my code, and consider unit testing and code review to be essential parts of the development process.
